### Task: 
A DNA sequence of nucleotides (length N) is given.

Find the smallest impact factor of the nucleotides (A, C, G and T with impact factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively) in certain DNA sub sequences. The DNA sub sequencesare given by P, a vector of starting indices and Q, a vector of according end indices (both length M)

### Solution:
See code.

time complexity: O(N + M)
